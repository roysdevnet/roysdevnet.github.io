    <h3>How to link back to a folder</h3>
    <p>So the first thing that I needed to do was to link back to the folder that 
        contained my CSS styles file. 
        So to link back to a holder you have to type ".//" to link back to a folder
        <h3>abbr</h3>
        <p></p>
        <abbr title="Ashish Dubey">My name</abbr>
        <p>So abbr creates a text which can be a given a value. So if you hover 
            on the text you can see the hidden value, or in other word the meaning 
            of the abbrevation
        </p>
        <acronym title="Ashish Dubey">My name</acronym>
        <address></address>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1> Who is sudhanshu singh
            <p>Sudhanshu singh is a very simple person</p>
        </h1>
